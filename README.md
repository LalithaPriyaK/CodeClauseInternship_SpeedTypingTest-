# CodeClauseInternship_SpeedTypingTest


This Python script initiates a speed typing test by displaying a predefined text. After prompting the user to press Enter, it records the start time and waits for the user to type the text. Upon completion, it calculates the elapsed time and determines the user's typing speed in words per minute. The script then provides feedback on the correctness of the input and displays the calculated typing speed. The entire process is contained within approximately 10 lines of code, leveraging the time module for time measurements and basic input/output functions for user interaction.
